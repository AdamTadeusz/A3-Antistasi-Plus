[b]Where is the HQ tent?[/b]

[b]I can't find the mission in Scenarios tab in single player menu, is there any way to play as single player?[/b]
Antistasi Plus will not appear in Scenarios menu, but you can still play as singe player by creating LAN server in Arma 3's multiplayer menu, it is pretty easy.

[b]My dedicated server is not working with this mission at all, while listen one works perfectly fine. What's wrong?[/b]
Make sure that you're not using -autoInit startup parameter, removing it might resolve many dedicated server issues.
